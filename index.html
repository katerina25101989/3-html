	<h2><b>What is HTML?</b></h2>
	<p><b>Hypertext Markup Language (<span id="punkt">HTML</span>)</b> is the standard markup language for creating web pages and web applications.</p>
	<p>Web browsers receive <span id="punkt">HTML</span> documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. <span id="punkt">HTML</span> describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.</p>

	
	<p>
		<span id="punkt">HTML</span> elements are the building blocks of <span id="punkt">HTML</span> pages. With <span id="punkt">HTML</span> constructs, images and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page.<span id="punkt">HTML</span>provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items. <span id="punkt">HTML</span> elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. Tags such as <span id="color1" >< </span><span id="color1"  >img /> </span> and  <span id="color1"><</span><span id="color1">input /> </span> directly introduce content into the page. Other tags such as<span id="color1" >< </span><span id="color1">p></span> surround and provide information about document text and may include other tags as sub-elements. Browsers do not display the <span id="punkt">HTML</span> tags, but use them to interpret the content of the page.

<h2><b>Markup</b></h2>
<p><span id="punkt">HTML</span> markup consists of several key components, including those called <i>tags</i> (and their attributes), character-based <i>data types, character references and entity references.</i> <span id="punkt">HTML</span> tags most commonly come in pairs like <span id="color1" ><</span><span id="color1" >h1></span> and <span id="color1" ><</span><span id="color1" >/h1></span>, although some represent <i>empty elements</i> and so are unpaired, for example <span id="color1" ><</span><span id="color1" >img></span>. The first tag in such a pair is the <i>start tag</i>, and the second is the <i>end tag</i> (they are also called <i>opening tags</i> and <i>closing tags</i>).
</p>
<p>Another important component is the<span id="punkt"> HTML</span> <i>document type declaration</i>, which triggers standards mode rendering.
</p>
<p>The following is an example of the classic "Hello, World!" program:
</p>
<span id = "color2" >
	<img src="1.bmp" alt="">

</span>
